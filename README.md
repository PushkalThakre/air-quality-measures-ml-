# 🌍 Air Quality Measures Analysis

This project provides an in-depth analysis of **air quality data** sourced from the **National Environmental Health Tracking Network**. The main goals are to clean and analyze the dataset, explore trends across regions and years, and build a simple **Linear Regression model** to predict average air quality measures over time.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- **Original Source:**  
  `Air_Quality_Measures_on_the_National_Environmental_Health_Tracking_Network.csv`

- **Cleaned Dataset:**  
  `Air_Quality_Measures_on_the_National_Environmental_Health_Tracking_Network (1).csv`

- **Selected Features for Analysis:**  
  - `MeasureId`  
  - `MeasureName`  
  - `MeasureType`  
  - `StateName`  
  - `CountyName`  
  - `ReportYear`  
  - `Value`

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

The initial dataset was cleaned by:
- Removing irrelevant columns  
- Handling missing values  
- Ensuring consistent datatypes  
- Retaining only essential fields for analysis and modeling

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1. Descriptive Statistics for `Value`

| Statistic | Value |
|------------|--------|
| **Count** | 404,394 |
| **Mean** | ≈ 20.89 |
| **Standard Deviation** | ≈ 31.06 |
| **Min** | 0.0 |
| **Max** | 275.0 |
| **Skewness** | ≈ 2.47 |
| **Kurtosis** | ≈ 8.79 |

> The distribution of `Value` (air quality measure score) is highly skewed, indicating potential outliers or metrics with large variances.

### 2. Temporal Trend

A time-series plot was created to visualize the **Average Air Quality Measure Value Over Years**, revealing how air quality trends have evolved.

### 3. Top 10 States by Average Value

| StateName | Average Value |
|------------|----------------|
| Oklahoma | 35.98 |
| West Virginia | 34.50 |
| New Jersey | 34.18 |
| Florida | 33.67 |
| North Carolina | 32.40 |
| South Carolina | 31.57 |
| Georgia | 31.03 |
| Tennessee | 29.98 |
| California | 29.21 |
| Illinois | 28.32 |

📊 *Visualization saved as:* `top_10_states_by_avg_value.png`

> These results highlight regional differences, with certain southern and midwestern states showing higher average air quality measure values.

## 🧠 Time-Series Modeling (Linear Regression)

A simple **Linear Regression** model was implemented using `sklearn` to predict the aggregated average air quality values based on the reporting year.

### 🔧 Modeling Workflow
1. **Data Aggregation:** Grouped data by `ReportYear` and computed the mean `AverageValue`  
2. **Split:** 80% training and 20% testing  
3. **Model:** `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`  
4. **Evaluation:** Model performance was assessed using MSE and R² metrics  

### 📈 Model Performance

| Metric | Result |
|---------|---------|
| **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** | 1.96 |
| **R-squared (R²) Score** | 0.66 |

> An R² score of 0.66 indicates that the linear trend of `ReportYear` explains approximately **66% of the variance** in annual average air quality measure values.

## 🔮 Prediction Output

| ReportYear | AverageValue | PredictedValue |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| 2000 | 30.83 | ≈ 30.60 |
| 2001 | 28.24 | ≈ 29.83 |
| 2002 | 31.32 | ≈ 29.07 |
| 2003 | 27.91 | ≈ 28.30 |
| 2004 | 25.92 | ≈ 27.53 |
